Newtral,https://www.newtral.es/,https://twitter.com/Newtral,https://www.facebook.com/NewtralMedia/,https://www.instagram.com/newtral/,https://www.youtube.com/@Newtral_,"Newtral specialises in audiovisual production, fact-checking and new narratives. It was founded in 2018 by journalist Ana Pastor, who is well-known in Spain as a television interviewer.
Pastor is the sole owner of the outlet, which today employs 72 people, including journalists, engineers, researchers, programmers, producers, directors, graphic designers and documentary makers.
""We are not a television production company, but we make programmes. We are not a media company, but we inform. In this new world, you don't have to be just one thing,"" said Pastor in an interview in 2019. Currently, the team is also working on a line of research and development in artificial intelligence.
Joaquín Ortega, content director, refers to Newtral's diverse activity and describes it as ""a media start-up focused on audiovisual production, fact-checking, new narratives and explanatory journalism; public service that reduces noise"". The company’s content includes science, politics, transparency, climate change, energy and gender equality. This content is published on its free-access website and on social networks, as well as a newsletter and a podcast.
Newtral’s name is the fusion of the words “news” and “neutral”, and its motto is ""stories that matter and fact-checking"". ""We don't defend any political party or ideology,"" says Ortega. ""It's the basis of fact-checking."" The methodology the outlet uses is available on its website.
The company derives its revenue from television production for clients such as Spanish broadcaster AtresMedia, Netflix or HBO, and from fact-checking work for companies such as Meta or TikTok, Ortega explains. In 2021, it had a turnover of €4.9 million and a profit of €158,000, according to the outlet's website.
Newtral is a verified member of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). In May 2019, the Newtral Education project was launched to help foster critical thinking in schools, colleges and universities. In 2020, Newtral established the Master's Degree in Digital Verification, Fact-Checking and Data Journalism in collaboration with San Pablo CEU University.
Among the lessons learned in the organisation’s first five years, Ortega highlights prioritising human relations in the team. ""It is something that was not foreseen, we have been creating a business culture that is not the usual one in the media,"" he says. A second lesson is related to the ""slow and quiet"" way in which the company grows as it adds new projects. ""It allows us to be creative, maintain our environment, be independent and do what we like,"" says Ortega.",23-Jun,"Madrid, Spain",2018,Spanish,"Science, Economy and business, Entrepreneurship, Economy and finance, Journalism industry, Education, Environment, Politics, Society and human rights, Gender, Feminism, LGBTIQ+, Ethnic minorities, Religious minorities, DEIA: Diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, Refugees, Migration, War crimes and transitional justice, Technology"
Equinox,https://www.equinoxmagazine.fr/,https://twitter.com/equinoxbcn,https://www.facebook.com/equinoxradio.barcelone,https://www.instagram.com/equinoxbarcelone/,https://www.youtube.com/user/bobbychon,"Two French journalists based in Barcelona decided to found an online radio station in 2011 to inform their compatriots living in the city about local news and culture. Aurélie Chamerois and Nico Salvadó were then working as correspondents for several French-speaking media, and dedicated a small part of their time to Equinox Radio. Three years later, they launched a news website, Equinox Magazine, which has been growing ever since. Today, they run a sustainable project that employs four full-time staff and four collaborators.
Its audience is made up of French people living in Catalonia. ""There are about 60,000 very heterogeneous people,"" says Chamerois. ""There are expatriates who have been living here for 25 years and people who have just arrived, as well as young people in their 20s and people in their 70s. We provide them all with a very pedagogical way of explaining, we help them integrate and understand what is happening in Catalan society. And we are very proud of how they value us.”
Equinox Radio today broadcasts only music online, since the weight of the editorial project is carried by Equinox Magazine. ""We realised that it was difficult for the audience to connect at a specific time to listen to the daily radio programme we were doing. We started to transcribe the audio to text on the website, and we saw that it was read much more than it was listened to. It also was very much shared on social media,"" recalls Chamerois. ""We started to cut radio programmes, and due to the huge demand for information during the Covid pandemic, we decided to devote all the effort to Equinox Magazine.""
The website is free to access, and offers information on current political and social events, cultural and weekend proposals, and live coverage when there is any important local news. It includes a weekly newsletter and two podcasts (one on Barcelona stories and the other on entrepreneurship).
The sources of revenue are local advertising, branded content, institutional advertising, events and the sale of content to French, Belgian and Canadian media. Equinox Magazine also accepts small private donations. ""Donations do not represent an important income, but they help us to have an open channel of engagement and relationship with our audience,"" says Chamerois.
The name “Equinox” refers to balance, since day and night last the same length of time on the equinox. Chamerois explains that they wanted a media outlet which would unite cultures. “We are a French medium in Catalonia and also a Catalan medium in French,” she says. Nico Salvadó explained it this way in an interview: ""Our DNA is half French and half Spanish, it represents the mixture of French and Spanish culture.”
The founders have accumulated several lessons, especially on the management side. ""As entrepreneurs, we have learned that we run a business. Many journalists find it hard to accept that role, but you can be a company and maintain your independence,"" Chamerois acknowledges. ""We have also learned to remain innovative, to be audacious, to use our freedom to try things out. The best example is that we were born as an online radio station, and today we are an online magazine.""",23-Jul,"Barcelona, Spain",2011,French,"Science, Entertainment and culture, Economy and business, Entrepreneurship, Economy and finance, Journalism industry, Education, Lifestyle, Law and crime, Environment, Politics, Society and human rights, Gender, Feminism, LGBTIQ+, Ethnic minorities, Religious minorities, DEIA: Diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, Refugees, Migration"

Iașul Nostru seeks to build a trustworthy, non-partisan newsroom that is devoted to strengthening the bonds that unite people in Iași, a medium-sized city in Eastern Romania, close to the borders with Moldova and Ukraine.
Their mission is to cover all of Iași through thoughtful reporting and aggregation that cuts through the noise, and helps locals understand what’s happening in their city. They do this by informing and engaging people in Iași through a weekly briefing that refocuses the news towards positive local developments, and spotlights local civic heroes and artists.
They also publish longform pieces that reflect the needs of community members at the margins — such as Ukrainian refugees and people with disabilities — as well as solution-oriented interviews with urban planning experts.
With this model, they have found that their readers come for the food and drink recommendations, but stay for the in-depth contextual coverage of local education, transportation and green space management.",23-Jul,"Iași, Romania",2021,Romanian,"Entertainment and culture, Economy and business, Entrepreneurship, Education, Lifestyle, Politics, Society and human rights, Refugees, Migration"
Bird in Flight,https://birdinflight.com/,,https://www.facebook.com/BifMagUA,https://www.instagram.com/bifmag/,,"Bird in Flight is a digital native magazine about photography and visual culture. The outlet was founded in 2014 by Depositphotos, and went fully independent from September 2022.
Its mission is to reach people who enjoy discovering the world through images, as well as those who are in search of a cultural impetus. Currently, Bird in Flight focuses on three main types of audience: creative people and photographers, IT professionals (ie those who are engaged with digital photography professionally or as a hobby), and a younger generation in search of cultural inspiration.
Bird in Flight publishes regularly, covering the following topics: people, events, exciting projects and new trends in the photo industry and the media, as well as stories about photographers from all over the world working in different genres, from recognised masters to young talents. The published pieces fall under one of the following categories: art, politics, architecture, design, film, sex and gaming. Since 2022, the outlet has experimented with a couple of formats in addition to photo projects and essays, including video, infographics, ratings and games.
Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia, Bird in Flight has also been documenting various aspects of war — from cultural resistance, to covering heroic deeds by the population. For example, an article featuring President Zelenskyy’s war attire reached over a million views, confirming the need for culturally entertaining stories during the war.
The invasion also affected the financial health of Bird in Flight, limiting its sources of financing to grants, as well as almost halving its revenue. The founders have also engaged in a few side projects since then, such as holding the international charity event Photographers for Children, which sold works by 74 Ukrainian authors for two weeks. The €12,650 raised was donated to the foundation Smile UA in Zaporizhzhia, which takes care of families with children and orphans affected by the war.",23-Jul,"Kyiv, Ukraine",2014,"English, Ukrainian, Russian",Entertainment and culture

As the website says: ""We don't just tell you that something is happening, but also why it happens and what it means."" Its approach is more constructive than critical, based on the idea that journalism is an active shaper of society.
As an organisation, Zetland is actively interested in strengthening the trust between journalists and the public. Denmark is not a particularly politically polarised country; the erosion of trust is more a consequence of the habits of the fast-paced news industry in general.
While Zetland journalists can write about any topic, the team has recurring coverage on technology and the internet. As one of the few news media, the newsroom has reported on the influence of foreign market actors on the Danish internet infrastructure and Danish politicians' use of marketing channels on Facebook. As such, Zetland's team publishes national and international stories.
In 2019 they launched an ambassador campaign among their members with the aim to grow their membership and become financially sustainable. With 4,000 members campaigning voluntarily the goal was reached within a month. Zetland's primary revenue comes from membership subscriptions; its main platform is its mobile app, not the website.
This year, they developed Good Tape, a secure transcription service for journalists (and others) that turns audio into text – regardless of language. “We've saved hundreds of boring hours at @Zetland, so we thought you'd might like as well :)” writes co-founder and editor-in-chief of Zetland Lea Korsgaard on her Twitter.",23-Jan,"19, Denmark",2016,Danish,"Science, Entertainment and culture, Sports, Economy and business, Entrepreneurship, Economy and finance, Journalism industry, Education, Lifestyle, Law and crime, Environment, Politics, Health and well-being, Society and human rights, Gender, Feminism, LGBTIQ+, Ethnic minorities, Religious minorities, DEIA: Diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, Refugees, Migration, War crimes and transitional justice, Technology"

The organisation is a market leader in the region, with 54 million pageviews and 6.8 million unique users a year. Its readership increased during the Covid-19 pandemic and before the general elections in April 2022. It has more than 100,000 followers on Facebook.
As a non-profit organisation, it employs nine full-time journalists and seven freelancers, while 10-15 people serve as volunteers.
National media often picks up its information. According to the organisation, direct contact with its readers is significant, as it must fight for credibility daily.
""We are under pressure from the state, which makes it harder to work year after year, month after month. Imagine a room where the oxygen is being slowly but constantly sucked out. At first, the people hardly notice anything. Then, their mood changes, and they feel tired, and then they gasp for air. Finally, they suffocate. We are currently in the 'gasping for air' phase,"" journalist Antal Józing said before the Council of Europe's Committee on Current Affairs meeting in Strasbourg in June 2022.
""We have never backed a single political party. Still, it should be noted that Szombathely, where our site is located, is one of the few Hungarian cities with opposition leaders. Not because we supported them but because we gave local citizens a real choice. Information is power. And the lack of it, too,"" he added.

The media outlet quickly became popular, known for its distinctive gonzo-style journalism and unique design.
""444.hu started as a lifeboat project to save the ethos and some journalists of the original Index.hu,"" said editor-in-chief Péter Uj. ""We started this project with the idea that we would do it as long as we somehow had the company's majority in our hands (...) We do not want to see it dismantled, taken away, outsourced, or sold. We will do this as long as we own this company"".
The ever-growing pressure of the Hungarian government on independent media and the advertising market meant that 444.hu had to find other sources of income to progress. For example, the organisation received grants and investments from the Media Development Investment Fund, philanthropic organisations, and other sources.
Most Hungarian news sites do not allow comments, so this became an essential community-building feature until 2016, when the organisation decided to limit it by introducing pre-moderation. A further restriction was implemented in 2019. Full-scale commenting for subscribers returned with the introduction of the paywall system in August 2021.
The site is also known for its podcasts, long reads, and videos about significant social trends and issues, from the sexual abuse of kids to parking scandals in the capital.
In January 2022, 444.hu started Lakmusz, a fact-checking site, part of the Hungarian Digital Media Observatory, with financial support from the European Commission.

""We are not limited by anything; we only write what we know, believe, and think. We are not dictated from above, with no oligarch, advertiser, or politician above or behind our newsroom. We are accountable only to our readers,"" the organisation's website states.

The goal is to provide an independent overview of the state of the media industry, track changes, and monitor new challenges in the industry.
Média1 was founded by its editor-in-chief Dániel Szalay, who provided the funds for the for-profit media company. Most of the for-profit company’s income comes from advertising and event sponsorship, but it also receives individual donations.

The organisation supports journalists and professionals, including representatives from activist groups, associations, governmental structures, or research centres, to communicate better about climate change and its consequences.
Its mission is to foster an open public debate about climate change through accurate and reliable information, and to motivate audiences to turn their knowledge into positive actions. To do so, the team works with a scientific advisory board and publishes the information after three independent reviews have fact-checked it.
Its primary formats include short reports, a fact-checking unit, current news, and practical examples of content, manuals, actors, and institutions with exemplary reporting on climate change. More recently, the organisation started providing workshops, presentations, and training on climate communication. Klimafakten.de also runs the K3 Klimakommunikationskonferenz (in English: Climate Communication Conference), which includes a journalism award honouring the best climate projects.
The media outlet, launched in 2011, is financed by the European Climate Foundation and the Mercator Foundation, alongside its sister project Clean Energy Wire. Through this, it remains an editorially independent, non-profit media outlet without political or economic interests.
Klimafakten.de was recognised by Environmental Action Germany with the Environmental Media Prize in 2017, and by the German Psychological Society (DGPs) with the Science Journalism Award in 2022.",23-Jan,"Berlin, Germany",2011,German,"Science, Environment"

It publishes stories on corruption, human rights, freedom, and social affairs in Azerbaijan and is a media partner of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).
Meydan TV offices and reporters often suffer attacks and censure. In 2014, the Meydan TV office in Berlin was attacked; in 2015, four Meydan TV journalists in Azerbaijan were banned from leaving the country. In 2016, 15 Meydan TV journalists were included in a criminal case initiated by the prosecutor's office in the country.
According to the co-founder of Meydan TV, Habib Muntazir, the organisation strives to provide Azerbaijani society with transparent information. However, due to regular bans, the website's accessibility decreases for Azerbaijani readers. The organisation created a mirror website to avoid the block placed on Meydan TV in Azerbaijan, but it was also blocked recently. As a result, there has been a sharp decrease in its audience.
Due to all these limitations, the editorial team tries to increase activity on social media, where the media outlet has 800,000 followers on Facebook and 556,000 on YouTube.

António Castelo, its founder, was aware that mainstream media wasn't paying attention to these topics. At the same time, he found that academia regularly studied and looked at some of these issues. However, he considered the academic language too difficult to understand. Both things led him to discover this gap in the media industry.
""Black people living in the outskirts of Lisbon or poor gay men living in marginalised areas of the city won't see themselves in the media or are unable to find references which make them feel seen, heard or understood,"" Castelo says.
Although Qi News works as a magazine publishing stories around these issues, it's through its YouTube channel that the audience usually encounters the outlet. Inspired by the web video stories produced by Vice News, Vox, the groundbreaking TV Channel 4's Unreported World, and some animated journalism, Castelo intended to make Qi News' YouTube channel the primary platform.
""A video with a yellow logo, moving pictures, people talking and things happening reaches more people. The language of web video is more open, even more so than TV, which has some stringent codes,"" António Castelo says.
Qi News is a reference to the measures of intelligence quotient or information quotient and is meant to be understood through the lens of what's possible because of democratization.

Before launching Reflekt, the collective shared a conviction: the organisation needed new ideas and financing models to have a future producing critical, independent, and in-depth journalism. In 2019, a few journalists founded Switzerland's first non-profit investigative team.
The media outlet aims to drive positive social change through investigative journalism, so it brings together professionals in small, powerful teams to carry out investigations with great impact and publish them through various channels. Unlike traditional editorial teams, the newsroom does not work under fixed publication forms or deadlines. This methodology allows it to work independently, draw on internal and external expertise, have the necessary time and resources to make its investigations accessible to the broadest possible audience, and thus, promote quality journalism, increase public awareness, and contribute to media diversity and a functioning democracy.
The non-profit association is financed through investigative reporting sold to various media, crowdfunding campaigns, donations from individuals, grants from multiple foundations, and awards for its journalistic work. In 2022, Reflekt also organised events and workshops. The media organisation publishes its annual reports on its website, aiming to be as transparent as possible.

It has been publicly accessible since 2008 as a database of witnesses' testimonies of 20th-century events and those who survived the two totalitarian regimes: nazism and communism. The stories illustrate how these regimes impacted individual lives, and it reveals their substance.
The collection is administered by the non-profit association Post Bellum, established in 2001 by journalists and historians, aiming to remember the importance of recording personal memories of World War II and communism.
""There is a last generation of people who witnessed totalitarian regimes, such as nazism and communism; we have a last chance to keep it. It should not be forgotten but preserved for the next generations,"" Mikuláš Kroupa, director of Post Bellum, said. ""We have collected more than 13,000 testimonies so far.""
Each witness is presented with a short biography and a longer text prepared by the author. The witness' story contains samples from the recording in audio or video clips, transcriptions, personal photos, and other documents.
Paměť národa is accessible to everyone interested in learning about the past and our history.
Post Bellum administers the collection alongside its partner organisations: Czech Radio, a public entity, and the Institute for the Study of Totalitarian Regimes. Post Bellum further collaborates with Czech Television and other organisations from Europe, Russia, the US, and elsewhere on the documentation and archiving of oral testimonies.

The outlet does not publish daily political stories but analyses and comments on current events. The founders aim to offer insights into public discussions on contemporary culture, politics and social issues.
""Our goal was to create a portal that would not primarily deal with informative but rather with analytical journalism and which would be space where authors could freely express their opinions, comments, and views and publish their stories. We tried to be authentic at the level of Montenegro but, in the traditional sense, we are closest to the concept of a weekly magazine,"" director Damjan Spasojević said.
KOMBINAT covers topics related to the Western Balkans, where most of its readership comes from; the idea of the media outlet was to interest young people primarily.
Although the outlet was launched in 2020, the newsroom started working in mid-2021. The uniqueness of the platform is its peculiar style, which dances on the border between journalistic and literary, and its visual identity, which the editorial team is particularly proud of. Namely, the authors mainly use illustrations created by team members in their texts, representing combinations of several photos related to the topic itself and further explaining it. Also, special sections (such as Word of the Week) are always illustrated similarly, emphasising the person's portrait.
KOMBINAT is financed through grants, but the plan is also to launch some new services (such as video services) and generate more revenue from marketing.",23-Jan,"Podgorica, Montenegro",2020,"English, Montenegrin, Serbian","Science, Entertainment and culture, Sports, Economy and business, Entrepreneurship, Economy and finance, Journalism industry, Education, Lifestyle, Law and crime, Environment, Politics, Health and well-being, Society and human rights, Gender, Feminism, LGBTIQ+, Ethnic minorities, Religious minorities, DEIA: Diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, Refugees, Migration, War crimes and transitional justice, Technology"

In 2013, after politician Andrej Babiš bought the Mafra company, to which newspapers Mladá fronta DNES and Lidové noviny belonged, Šafr decided to found his own media outlet. In 2015, he launched a platform called Svobodne forum; in 2017, it was renamed FORUM 24 and focused mainly on opinion journalism.
""It was a big change for me; I was always in print,"" Šafr says. That same year he started to print monthly magazines and, in August 2021, launched a weekly magazine with the slogan: ""We are returning the newspaper to the people.""

The founder is the Roma youth organisation Koračajte sa nama - Phiren Amenca, headed by the first Roma TV editor and presenter in Montenegro, Elvis Berisha.
The intention of the founders was to have young people from the Roma community leading the outlet but this was a challenge because, they claim, journalism is often viewed negatively by many community members.
""They see it as a way to expose everything bad in the Roma community and its customs. No one could have guessed that someone would engage in activist work through journalism,"" says founder Elvis Berisha.
Berisha explains that they overcame these problems by solving some of the most topical issues affecting Roma settlements. For example, they wrote about the fact that in some Roma settlements there were no vehicle retarders on roads and cars moved at high speed, which led to frequent traffic accidents, often endangering people's lives. The team did not report only about the problem, but also wrote to the local municipality and finally solved it. ""Our interlocutors then realised that, with the help of journalism, you can influence change, and so their approach and attitude towards us has changed,"" Berisha says.
RomaNet's goal is not only to raise the general public's awareness of the Roma community, but also to reduce stereotypes and prejudices toward them.
For the first 18 months the team, which consisted of people in high school or university, worked voluntarily. In 2019, the media outlet received project-based grant funding, enabling it to hire three people and purchase equipment. However, the outlet's sustainability is still on stake. According to the team, although project-based grant funding enables editorial independence, it also creates enormous uncertainty. In addition, insufficient funds make it difficult to promote the publication.
Currently the team amounts to four journalists and the founder/editor. The articles are written in the Montenegrin and Romani languages, although there are fewer texts in Romani because they do not have the possibility to hire enough journalists from the community.",23-Jan,"Podgorica, Montenegro",2017,"Romani, Montenegrin","Science, Entertainment and culture, Sports, Economy and business, Entrepreneurship, Economy and finance, Journalism industry, Education, Law and crime, Environment, Politics, Society and human rights, Gender, Feminism, LGBTIQ+, Ethnic minorities, Religious minorities, DEIA: Diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, Refugees, Migration, War crimes and transitional justice, Technology"

It represents the first successful project implemented by the non-governmental organisation PRONEN, whose goal is to encourage the development of new digital media in Montenegro. The NGO and the website were the response of a group of enthusiasts to society's demands for information and the inclusion of Montenegro in the ""civilisation of mobile text"".
The media outlet was launched during the Yugoslav wars, when the media industry was more polarised than ever. A division emerged between media organisations for and against the war, and for and against the government. The founders of PCNEN chose not to take a stand on important political issues, and instead tried to be a forum for debate and discussion. For that purpose, the organisation launched a column called Inciting Dialogue.
""It was a provocative metaphor that offered the opposite of the current state of society. They incited us to hatred and war, and we encouraged dialogue,"" says co-founder Dusko Vukovic.
A few years later, the team considered selling the media outlet. However, people from the diaspora came forward and helped with a modest amount of money, and the founders decided to keep it. According to them, it is challenging to maintain independence and enthusiasm after two decades of volunteer work.
During the last few years, PCNEN has started to be financed by project-based grant funding. However, the organisation's biggest problem is finding and retaining a team of journalists to write for the media outlet.

Beyond the regular publications on its website, Tsüri.ch uses the opportunities of the web to reach out to and interact with its audience, through its community on social media and via a variety of newsletters that reflect the diverse interests of its readers: a daily briefing, a weekly newsletter, a weekly briefing about local council meetings, a monthly climate briefing, a newsletter with competitions and raffles, and updates on the offline events organised by the media outlet.
Tsüri.ch sends a daily email news briefing at 7 am, summarising the day's most important news; a monthly newsletter; and a cultural events calendar for event tips and other helpful information.

Thanks to the internet, it is now much easier for them to receive and interact with their community. One-way communication is broken up, and an equal relationship is created between users and journalists. For example, stories can be told as quizzes or ratings, and the community can incorporate their input directly into the reporting. Direct exchange increases the quality of journalism because the users and the editors have to deal with the content more deeply. For example as a walk, a game, a workshop, a discussion or theatre.""

So, when journalist Rihannon J Davies moved to this area in 2018, she felt the need to challenge the negative stereotypes and show a realistic portrayal of the area. She aimed to show what Govanhill is: a place with diverse cultures living together, a wealth of community projects, and independent retailers.
In March 2020, after a community consultation, she created a website and published information about the local community. In December 2020, Greater Govanhill published the first free issue of its printed magazine, telling local stories and connecting the Govanhill community.
Aware of the many cultures, languages and social groups co-existing in Govanhill, the information is available in the following languages: Urdu, Arabic, Polish, Czech, Slovak, and Latvian.
The free print magazine brings high-quality journalism information to residents and guarantees that people who can't access the website will still be able to read Greater Govanhill's content.
The organisation is a Community Interest Company (CIC) regulated by IMPRESS, and it is also an Independent Community News Network (ICNN) member. It won several awards, including the Social Enterprise Scotland Award in 2021, the Launch / Relaunch of the Year category from the PPA Scotland Awards in 2021, and the Regional Supplement/Magazine of the Year from the Newsawards in 2021.
Furthermore, the organisation develops various community projects, especially with young people, thanks to the financial support of grants from philanthropic organisations and local government, print advertising, consultancy services, paid members, individual donations, crowdfunding campaigns, and event ticket sales.
Some of these projects are a radio show on a local community station, and journalism skills training for young people from underrepresented backgrounds.

As stated on its website, the association's primary goal is to improve the position of young people in society through information, education, increasing employability, and raising society's awareness of issues concerning young people.
More specifically, by creating Mladi Berana, the goal is to inform young people in the municipalities where Mladi Info Montenegro had most of its activities and where the organisation estimated that there was a significant lack of information.
""Often young people found out about opportunities or events while they were in progress, or even after they were over, and so they could not participate in them,"" the organisation's director, Milica Žugić, says.
The team cooperates with the local municipality to ensure timely information. Over time, it has realised that its readership consists not only of young people, but also of older ones, based both in Berane and other cities and countries.
The newsroom consists only of young people, who independently choose topics, events, or people to write about, focusing primarily on the interests of their peers. The outlet's intention and editorial strategy are to report on problems but also to influence potential solutions through mobilising the public or by putting pressure on the local government.
""We want citizens to see us as their service, to let us know when there is a problem, but we also want to provide them with feedback and answers,"" concludes Žugić.
The most pressing issue the media organisation faces is financial sustainability. The newsroom works mainly voluntarily and is financed only through occasional grants and individual donations, which does not guarantee its long-term sustainability.",23-Jan,"Berane, Montenegro",2017,Montenegrin,"Science, Entertainment and culture, Sports, Education, Lifestyle, Law and crime, Environment, Health and well-being, Society and human rights, Gender, Feminism, LGBTIQ+, Ethnic minorities, Religious minorities, DEIA: Diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, Refugees, Migration, War crimes and transitional justice, Technology"

The portal has published some highly controversial stories in a short period. For example, it published a story about the misuse of state money and payments from the account of the company Plantaže (wine producer and distributor) to private individuals related to the former ruling party DPS. The newsroom has also published several investigative stories about irregularities related to the voter list, domestic politics, and the sports industry.

When he read this message from a reader, journalist Oscar Allende knew he was sailing in the right direction. In 2012, convinced that the way of telling the reality by traditional media did not fit with what was happening in the streets of his community, he decided to found an independent digital media, El Faradio.
Allende and fellow journalist Guillem Ruisánchez founded it to change the news agenda and talk about issues that were not in the traditional local media, such as the stories of the most vulnerable people, those affected by the financial crisis, or those affected by evictions. The media outlet also gives visibility to people in the cultural and social sphere who do not appear in the traditional media. ""We also bring a more critical voice to companies and institutions,"" Allende said.
El Faradio employs two people and a part-time collaborator. It is supported by the contributions of its 180 members and by income from advertising and communication services.
It has a daily morning radio programme in which the organisation reviews the life of the province of Cantabria and its capital, Santander. The radio is an additional channel to reach the audience and diversify advertising revenues.
During its first 10 years, the organisation has created a community of people with whom the newsroom interacts by email, telephone, or face-to-face. The team also holds an annual meeting with its members. ""Our most important milestone has been to survive,"" Allende acknowledged.
The organisation has received awards for its work on disabilities, the environment (special mention), the LGBTIQ+ community, social rights, and development cooperation, as well as an investigative journalism award aimed at the publication of a book on urban planning and its social impact in Santander.",23-Jan,"Santander, Spain",2012,Spanish,"Science, Entertainment and culture, Sports, Economy and business, Entrepreneurship, Education, Lifestyle, Environment, Politics, Society and human rights, Gender, Feminism, LGBTIQ+, Ethnic minorities, Religious minorities, DEIA: Diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, Refugees"

They envisioned becoming an independent digital media outlet that would compete in audience and credibility with legacy media without public aid or bank loans, recalled co-founder José Antonio Sánchez in an article.
According to its website, today the outlet has reached 25 million unique visitors monthly.
El Confidencial started as a digital media outlet specialising in financial and business information, and has evolved into a generalist medium with a special emphasis on politics and economics. According to its website, it employs 185 people, and its primary source of revenue is advertising. It also has a content agency called EC Brands, which offers strategy, communication, branded content services, and event productions.
In 2020 it implemented a paywall, and two years later, it reached 35,000 subscribers, according to its website. ""In this critical moment a rigorous, analytical, editorially and economically independent press is required, one that does not allow itself to be influenced, that uncovers information and also helps to think about the future,"" an article written by its director, Nacho Cardero, stated.
One of its hallmarks is investigative journalism. It was one of the international media outlets that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2016 for publishing The Panama Papers together with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).
In 2020, the Spanish energy company Iberdrola filed a 17.6m euros lawsuit against El Confidencial for an article it published about the company's executives being under judicial investigation for their possible relationship with an espionage plot.
Its director, Nacho Cardero, wrote an article in which he defined his legacy: ""In 20 years, I want El Confidencial to be remembered as a media that has contributed to making a better world.""",23-Jan,"Madrid, Spain",2001,Spanish,"Science, Entertainment and culture, Sports, Economy and business, Entrepreneurship, Economy and finance, Journalism industry, Education, Lifestyle, Law and crime, Environment, Politics, Health and well-being, Society and human rights, Gender, Feminism, LGBTIQ+, Ethnic minorities, Religious minorities, DEIA: Diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, Refugees, Migration, War crimes and transitional justice, Technology"

Driven by this idea expressed by deputy editor Juanlu Sánchez amid an economic crisis and social turmoil in Spain, in 2012 a group of unemployed journalists saw an opportunity to deal with political and social issues in a way that the traditional media did not.
Led by their executive director, Ignacio Escolar, they invested their savings to found a company and made it profitable from the first year without needing bank loans or other debts, thus guaranteeing their independence. In 2018, Escolar received the Gabriel García Márquez Prize for Journalism.
elDiario.es is ""an independent, left-wing information initiative committed to social values, transparency and which believes in journalism as a public service, avoiding falling into ideological and partisan clichés,"" Sánchez explained.
The outlet operates a membership model that today has 60,000 paying members who contribute an average of 82 euros per year. Half of its revenue comes from members and the other half from advertising. According to its accounts, the organisation reinvests its profits in hiring journalists, improving salaries, and technology.
In addition to its website, it publishes a quarterly printed magazine, and it has two additional daily products: a morning newsletter that reaches more than 100,000 subscribers, and a podcast where journalists explain current affairs to 20,000 daily listeners.
During the pandemic and in the face of the advertising crisis, elDiario.es asked its readers for help and 22,000 new members signed up. As the team explains on its website, without this growth, for the first time a year would have ended with losses.

A group of civil society representatives launched the new media outlet in 2016, aiming to be an alternative source of information for a young audience, and to publish human rights, corruption cases, and social affairs stories in Azerbaijan.
Shortly after launching, AbzasMedia published articles about several corruption cases in government institutions, including the violations in Azerbaijan's State Oil Company and the personal business of the president's family. Following the publication of the articles, the website was repeatedly cyber-attacked.
In April 2017, AbzasMedia's web domain (.net) was blocked. In October 2017, its co-founder Ulvi Hasanli was sent to military service, weakening the media organisation. Once Hasanli returned to civilian life in 2018, he discovered that the media outlet operated only through proxy links, and its audience had decreased by 10 times. AbzasMedia switched to a new web domain (.org).
AbzasMedia is currently accessible through www.abzas.org; however, the www.abzas.net domain is still banned in the country.
The media outlet publishes only in Azerbaijani and only covers the Azerbaijani audience. However, Hasanli hopes to expand the organisation's activities in the coming years, including the launch of an English version of the site.

Striving to uncover social-cultural topics beyond certain boundaries, Movement narrates stories about people using contemporary media technologies and the unconventional movement of a camera.
Its mission is to bring social impact through storytelling, and to influence and change the attitudes of its audience towards various topics. While the media outlet mostly does storytelling through short films centred on humans as the main heroes, its second media platform Movement EDU creates animated videos on topics such as science, literature, culture, democracy, and human rights, aiming to raise awareness and educate youth on specific issues.
Over the years, the team has worked on numerous special projects outside Georgia, reporting stories from around the world. To further diversify the content and broaden the horizons of its audience, in September 2022, Movement opened its second bureau in Paris.
Movement also offers storytelling services to small and large companies through its production studio to diversify its income sources and support its work.

Chai Khana believes that open access to information through issue-based multimedia information can catalyse positive change, and that investing in young journalists' skills can create positive returns for the media industry, communities, and the South Caucasus.
The media outlet has a very symbolic name: Chai Khana means ""tea house"". Historically, tea houses have been male-dominated in the Caucasus. It is where men usually gather, socialise, and exchange ideas. Chai Khana, a women-led platform, reclaims this male-dominated space to discuss its own topics and stories. It aims to deconstruct this concept and provide an open space for dialogue for women, queer people, ethnic, racial, and religious minorities, conflict-affected people, and other marginalised groups in Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, and regions in conflict.
Chai Khana started in 2015 as it found no high-quality visual storytelling. It regularly commissions stories from freelance visual storytellers to give them the space to produce their stories. The media outlet has created a network of documentary filmmakers, photographers, and journalists from all over the South Caucasus.
It trains young professionals through fellowships and training programmes.
Chai Khana also implements special projects, such as hosting exhibitions, film screenings, or printing photo books.

By the end of the year, supported by the European Endowment for Democracy (EED), OC Media became an independent organisation. Its mission is to keep high-level decision-makers and stakeholders (such as governments and local diplomats) informed about the Caucasus by providing reliable, fact-checked information in English.
While most of OC Media's reporting is accessible in English, it also reaches the local communities in their languages through partnerships. In 2021, OC Media partnered with six media outlets (On.ge, CivilNet, Mikroskop Media, Sova, JNews, and Abzas Media) to translate and republish its original reporting in Georgian, Azerbaijani, Armenian, and Russian. As a result, OC Media connects the Caucasian countries and supports peacebuilding, strengthening partners by providing financial support with original information from the Caucasus.
In 2020, during the 44-day war between Azerbaijan and Armenia, OC Media published Voices of Peace, a series of opinion pieces by people who publicly opposed the war.
In addition to the information accessible on the website, OC Media also distributes a weekly English-language newsletter with in-house information, such as reflections on the news by staff and editors. A monthly newsletter is also sent to individual donors to provide information on what is happening behind the scenes and discuss ongoing challenges.
In 2022, the media outlet started to produce a podcast with the editor-in-chief and staff writers reflecting on the weekly news and discussing the deeper context.

Project 64 uses explanatory journalism to prevent the audience from being vulnerable to misinformation, thus creating information that can be discussed over a cup of coffee by the older generation — people who usually do not have access to information with context.

It was established in response to President Yanukovych's refusal to sign the EU association agreement and the subsequent Euromaidan protests.
Its mission is to explain relevant issues for Ukrainians and to share and discuss various opinions and points of view.
The organisation is funded by viewers, donors, advertising, and licensing programmes to other broadcasters. Its footage is widely used in documentaries and other programmes globally.
When created in 2013, Hromadske received three grants: from the International Renaissance Foundation, the US Embassy, and the Embassy of the Netherlands. The media outlet began to work with the support of these donors, but with the onset of the Revolution of Dignity, the money was not enough, so Hromadske began to seek viewers' support. Fundraising started in December 2013, and in just 46 days, the organisation raised 1m hryvnias.
Hromadske is transparent regarding its finances and is one of the media outlets in Ukraine that publicly shares its financial reports and annual independent audits.
In 2021, Hromadske was included in the rating of financially transparent media in Ukraine, according to a study by the Institute of Mass Information.

Before the media organisation was launched in 2017, the sparsely populated towns and cities of Dalarma were largely overlooked due to the centralisation of most Swedish media organisations.
""Regional media downsized their presence in these communities,"" the co-founder and CEO Thorbjörn Carlsson says. ""We wanted to move in the opposite direction: to decentralise and therefore be closer to our readership.""
If nobody covers the region you live in, Carlsson said, ""you start to think you and your community are unimportant"". Siljan News has different websites for each municipality they cover.

""Each time a problem of great magnitude came up,"" says Kvartal's editor-in-chief Jörgen Huitfeldt, ""everyone seemed unprepared.""
The founders convinced a network of influential people in a given discipline or sector to write well-researched articles about their field of competence.
In 2018, Huitfeldt took over as editor-in-chief; he employed six professional journalists with specific expertise and academic background. ""Our promise to the audience is to offer Sweden's leading platform for serious, constructive and non-polarising conversations and discussions about society, politics, economics and culture,"" Huitfeldt says.
Kvartal's reporters try to cover stories and viewpoints that mainstream media overlook. At Kvartal, podcasts are just as important as written texts.
The website explains: ""The mission of the Fourth Estate includes covering problems that the people experience, demanding answers from the political power, demonstrating when abuse of power or mismanagement occurs, and contributing to a debate that is constructive and moves society forward. Kvartal has arisen from a longing for community-driven journalism that lives up to this original principle.""",23-Feb,"Stockholm, Sweden",2016,"English, Swedish","Science, Economy and business, Entrepreneurship, Economy and finance, Education, Law and crime, Environment, Politics, Health and well-being, Society and human rights, Gender, Feminism, LGBTIQ+, Ethnic minorities, Religious minorities, DEIA: Diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, Refugees, Migration, Technology"

That is the magazine's mission: to help understand international affairs and how they affect people through slow journalism and the stories of its protagonists.
The project was founded in 2015 by nine Spanish journalists who had served together as special envoys and correspondents abroad and believed there was a gap for independent media paying attention to stories that had no place in the traditional media agenda.
A crowdfunding campaign was decisive in the launch of the project. The goal was to achieve 20,000 euros in 40 days, and this was achieved in just 40 hours. They finally obtained 50,000 euros, which they added to their personal investments to launch a company where the nine partners keep an equal share.
Today Revista 5W has 4,600 members and has been sustainable so far thanks to them. Up to 90% of revenue comes from memberships and sales of a print magazine. Since its foundation, it has added other products such as books, newsletters and podcasts.
But the media outlet's last annual report in September 2022 calls for support. Under the headline ""We need help to survive"", the team explains that its revenues dropped 10% last year, and the expenses exceeded income. ""Our survival depends on our members, those of you who read and support us, now more than ever.""
Led by director Agus Morales, four founders work full-time, and the rest collaborate. Although the team has an office in Barcelona, its members maintain a nomadic spirit. ""In seven years, we have never physically met all together,"" managing editor Maribe Izcue recalls.
The magazine has received several national and international recognitions, such as the Ortega y Gasset and the Gabo Award.",23-Jan,"Barcelona, Spain",2015,Spanish,"Education, Environment, Politics, Health and well-being, Society and human rights, Gender, Feminism, LGBTIQ+, Ethnic minorities, Religious minorities, DEIA: Diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, Refugees, Migration, War crimes and transitional justice"

The organisation uses journalism, technology and advocacy as it acts as a lobbyist to propose and achieve legal changes. The team also goes to court to demand public information. Its motto is ""journalism and action to monitor the public sphere"".
Its proudest achievement is to have influenced the Spanish Public Contracts Act. The organisation made proposals that were incorporated into the law, including the transparency of the entire process; ensuring that the identity of the bidders is known; and the creation of an independent control system. ""If a small team can have such an impact on a legislative process, imagine what large companies or lobbies can do,"" communications manager Javier de Vega says.
Civio was born in 2012 with the savings of its two founders, a software developer and an economist. They began developing data access and visualisation tools so that citizens could access public information. ""Civio's differential value was to be an organisation that wanted to inform and involve citizens, convince them to exercise their right to scrutinise governments, and help them to do so,"" De Vega says.
The organisation sees information as a public service, so it offers it without cost or paywall, opinion pieces or advertising interests. Its sources of income are grants from the European Union and other organisations, consultancy to public administrations, and its 1,400 members.
""It's easier to get funding for our technical tools projects than for journalism,"" De Vega confesses.

Its four founders aimed to fill an existing gap: ""We adapted local information to new digital trends, new narratives, audiovisuals; we revolutionised the local media ecosystem in a certain sense,"" says co-founder and director Manuel Martín.
The outlet also provides proximity by publishing stories on social issues affecting the lives of citizens, and immediacy: ""Until then, the local media were not in a hurry to tell things as they happened; they did not try to be the first ones to tell a story,"" Martín recalls.
Nuevecuatrouno has a team of 10 people and obtains its revenue from advertising. ""In such a small province, it is very difficult for a publication to sustain itself with the readers' contribution,"" Martín reflects.
Furthermore, it found an information gap in the wine industry, which is very important in La Rioja. So the team launched a newsletter and a printed yearbook on this topic: ""We are a reference for this content, and we are very proud of it,"" Martín says.

The show's concept is that one of the two hosts prepares a specific historical topic from any geographic region and historical era, while the other never knows what the first will tell him.

An essential part of the podcast is the relationship and interaction with its audience; that's why each episode considers feedback from listeners, including details about historical facts and pronunciation. They produce a monthly episode offering in-depth feedback, including crowd-sourced information from the audience and other historians.

This aspect of contemporary performing arts production is often outside the state institutional network, and is produced by NGOs as opposed to state and municipal institutions.

In 2010, two film bloggers petitioned to bring the cinema back. The petition was signed by thousands of people and stirred a conversation about cinema and public service. That petition was the beginning of something else for one of the film bloggers behind the initiative, Luís Mendonça.
À Pala de Walsh was born in 2012, aiming to be a digital space to write film critiques and deconstruct films creatively. ""We can write a critique about a film focusing on just two shots of that film. We produce true essays about films, which include our subjectivity and references to our context watching films,"" Luís Mendonça says.
The team draws inspiration from the work of renowned film critics such as André Bazin and Serge Daney from Cahiers du Cinéma, the French film magazine. In 2015, Cahiers du Cinéma considered À Pala de Walsh the ""most important website"" about cinema in Portugal.
À Pala de Walsh's name refers to movie directors who wore an eyepatch, specifically Raoul Walsh. It roughly translates as On the Shoulders of Walsh. In Portuguese, à pala has a triple meaning: pala is the Portuguese word for eyepatch; à pala can be read both as the act of standing on the shoulders of something or someone bigger than ourselves, or as the colloquial way to describe something obtained for free.
Accordingly, the website is free and supported by its writers, who work voluntarily by investing their time and energy to publish long-form pieces and original essays about film.
